# Assignment 2

If you are a programmer you have a 99% chance of using a JavaScript library or Framework.
A **framework**[1] is a library of pre-witten JavaScript which mostly allows for easier development of
JavaScript based applications. As most developer see libraries as a blessing, many people argue that in many cases using a library isn't the beste route to take.

As stated in the **FED Handbook 2017**: [2]
> Learn the actual underlying technologies, before learning abstractions.

A JavaScript library comes with a layer of abstraction. It hides the core functionality and implementation
of vanilla JavaScript. Below are some pros and cons for using a JavaScipt library or framework. Most of them are
from a jQuery standpoint but below principles apply to many of the popular JavaScript libraries.

---
## Pros
* You can write faster JavaScript for development
* Libraries have a great open-source community behind them with many contributors.
* Create visual and "fancy" effects way faster than in vanilla JavaScript.
* Pointed out by **Rijk van Zanten** [3]: Dom manipulation and selection is way quicker.


## Cons
* Some libraries have very heavy JavaScript files and add extra (unessecary) load time.
* Related to the above; you load a whole library for sometimes one single feature.
* As **Stephen Hay** [4] pointed out: "It is a huge commitment for a team" to step over to a library.
* Many jQuery methods can now be done with native JS methods.
* The landscape of libraries is rapidly shifting and changing. If you learn the basic JavaScript
concepts you can understand what the libraries do underwater and make them your own faster.
